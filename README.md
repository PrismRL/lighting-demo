# lighting demo

This is the [prism template](https://github.com/PrismRL/prism-template) with the minimum required 
to implement the lighting module. The [level state](https://github.com/PrismRL/lighting-demo/blob/main/modules/game/gamestates/gamelevelstate.lua) has all of the changes documented.

For a more fulsome example, you can check out our game [Below the Garden](https://github.com/PrismRL/below-the-garden),
which makes extensive use of the lighting module.
